### DEV NOTE:
<br>
This is my current final portfolio project. I will be making constant updates and changes as I design new websites and applications, as well as regularly debugging any issues that may arise. <br>
<br>
A mobile responsive construction of this application is currently being developed. Please check back for updates, fixes, and cool new features! <br>
