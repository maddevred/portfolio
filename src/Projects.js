    <p>This is an application to host an official, user-friendly musical e-commerce website. This application is currently still in progress, and I am learning a new skill with every feature added. 
        So far, I have had the most fun playing with the CSS animations for this apps title. Please check back for more updates, fixes, and cool features soon!
        Built using HTML/CSS, React bootstrap, Javascript, and React-Scroll (open source code here:

and hosted publicly on Heroku. </p>

    <p>Team Project. Full-stack application to find tattoo inspiration as well as local tattoo shops, both of which can be saved and added to a user profile for future use. 
        Additionally, users can see tattoos they are interested in on a hypothetical body part of their choosing. 
        Built using mongoDB, React, Axios, Cloudinary and Bootstrap Styling, as well as API routing.
        One of the challenges we faced as a team was communicating the way our instructors told us to.
        We did not enjoy being on camera when coding because for some of us it throws our focus, so 
        we solved this issue by utilizing Slack to our fullest advantage and doing group phone calls instead. 
        This greatly improved our communication and we publicly deployed and presented our application with minimul bugs.    
        Deployed and hosted on Heroku. </p>
