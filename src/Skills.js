<h5>Who I Am</h5>    

    <p>My name is Amari James and I am a software developer specializing in developing <strong>agile, conceptualized, and polished digital software. </strong> 
    Not only do I have todayâ€™s relevant and necessary hard computer skills and education, I also possess something many candidates do not have- <strong>the motivation to advance and grow along with my industry. </strong>  
    I may not have everything you are looking for in a developer, but I have a <strong>willingness to learn that is unlike any other and a work ethic to match. </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Software Engineering Certification, General Assembly, 2021 | </em></strong>
    Our cohort learned fundamental skills including computer science framework, collaboration tools, and the programming languages modern employers demand. 
    Throughout the bootcamp, we retained fluency in multiple frameworks and stacks, applied essential object-oriented programming concepts, and leveraged JavaScript libraries like React, and incorporated functionality from third-party APIs and added complexity and nuance with Python, Django, etc. 
    By the conclusion of the cohort, we discovered how to effectively communicate and collaborate with web development teams to carry out complex projects from concept to completion and practiced version control with Git and GitHub while executing all software engineering projects in an Agile development workflow.
    With more than 500 continuous hours of instruction over a 12-week period, this bootcamp gave me real-world technological experience and allowed me to become more efficient in producing materials within short time periods, working under extreme deadlines, and consistently accomplishing quality results even under immense pressure.</p>
